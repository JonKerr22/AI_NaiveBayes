part 1 idea:
	basically going over training images to create "heat maps" of different digits 0-9, and then 
	associate those heat maps with the given labels, these should be collective
	over the course of the entire training, so combine them using math from assignment

	confusion matrix: what's hot in the one heat map for a label that's also
	hot in another, possibly confusing algorithm over which one to pick

	odds ratios: which features of a particular label are most striking and 
	stand out the most, what's the hottest part of the collective heat map
	for a label means the pixels that are "on" most often for various pics
	of that label, label just being digits for part 1

	do not distinguish between '#' and '+', they are both just 1 for the
	odds map

part 2 idea:
	almost the exact same as part 1, but instead of digits
	we're looking at audio patterns to determine if they
	are "yes" or "no" in Hebrew, audio patterns presented 
	in text form too, so similar code will be used across both
